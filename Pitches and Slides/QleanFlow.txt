QleanFlow

Slide 1 â€“ Bold Claim
Weâ€™re all drinking mercury.
Not just rural villagers.
Not just those near mining sites.
It's in your water too.

Slide 2 â€“ What's in Our Water?
    â€¢ Mercury
    â€¢ Arsenic
    â€¢ Cyanide
    â€¢ Lead
    â€¢ Coliforms
ðŸ‘‰ These arenâ€™t distant problems â€” theyâ€™re already in over 60% of surface water sources near mining zones in Ghana.

Slide 3 â€“ Where Does It Start?
It starts here:
    â€¢ River Pra
    â€¢ Offin
    â€¢ Ankobra
    â€¢ Black Volta
    â€¢ White Volta
All of them polluted by illegal mining (GALAMSEY) operations.

Slide 4 â€“ The Route
    â€¢ Contaminants seep into:
        â—¦ Groundwater
        â—¦ Streams
        â—¦ Boreholes
        â—¦ Farmlands
    â€¢ Then into your cup, your food, and eventually...
        â—¦ Your bloodstream

 Slide 5 â€“ Oops!
That "clear" water?
Itâ€™s not clean.
Over 30% of water samples that look clean in mining zones are chemically unsafe to drink.
No odor. No color.
Just poison.

Slide 6 â€“ The Metrics (Verifiable Data)
    â€¢ 5,000+ children in Ghana suffer from waterborne diseases yearly in mining-affected regions
    â€¢ 20+ communities rely solely on polluted rivers
    â€¢ 1 out of every 4 water samples from affected zones show toxic contamination

Slide 7 â€“ Spoiler Alert
Water purification alone won't save us.
Without smart distribution, the clean water never reaches those who need it most.

Slide 8 â€“ How It Gets Into Us
    â€¢ We bathe in it.
    â€¢ We cook with it.

    â€¢ We irrigate with it.
    â€¢ We give it to our children.
The body doesn't reject mercury â€” it absorbs it.
And it stays.

Slide 9 â€“ The Impact (Annually)
    â€¢ 2,300+ reported water poisoning cases (underreported)
    â€¢ $13M in health costs related to water contamination in mining zones
    â€¢ Agricultural yield drops due to polluted irrigation
    â€¢ Unreported long-term damage to kidneys, brains, unborn children

Slide 10 â€“ Fix It?
Yes.
But not with guesswork, random drilling, or politics.
We need:
    â€¢ Real-time data
    â€¢ Smart purification deployment
    â€¢ Efficient water distribution

Slide 11 â€“ Reality Check
Current efforts:
    â€¢ Random boreholes
    â€¢ Manual testing
    â€¢ No prioritization
    â€¢ No real tracking
    â€¢ High cost, low impact

Slide 12 â€“ Our Solution: QleanFlow
QleanFlow is a quantum-powered system that detects, purifies, and distributes clean water â€” starting with Ghanaâ€™s most contaminated zones.

 Slide 13 â€“ How It Works
    â€¢ Quantum clustering identifies high-risk zones
    â€¢ QAOA optimizes water delivery routes
    â€¢ Sensors + datasets inform purification needs
    â€¢ Dashboard visualizes risk, routes, and delivery in real-time

 Slide 14 â€“ Roadmap
Phase 1: Synthetic data, modeling, prototype
Phase 2: Deploy in 3 mining-affected regions
Phase 3: Partner with NGOs, scale to other West African nations
Phase 4: Real-time satellite/sensor data + predictive alerts

 Slide 15 â€“ Infrastructure
    â€¢ Modular purification units (solar-powered)
    â€¢ Existing logistics for distribution
    â€¢ NGO & Government data integrations
    â€¢ Lightweight frontend + backend + quantum API integration

 Slide 16 â€“ Business Model
    â€¢ B2G / B2NGO SaaS solution
    â€¢ Licensing dashboard + route optimization tools
    â€¢ Offer purification units as bundled or freemium
    â€¢ Grants + SDG partnerships for initial scale

 Slide 17 â€“ SDG Alignment
    â€¢ SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation
    â€¢ SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being
    â€¢ SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production
    â€¢ SDG 13: Climate Action
    â€¢ SDG 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
